# Cation Language

Cation is a modern general-purpose programming language made with category theory in mind. It is purely functional
and uses statical and strong generalized algebraic data types known as [strict types][strict types].

The language design and compiler is a work in progress. The compiler will compile the code into LLVM and [AluVM](AluVM)
targets, and a special cross-compiler from Cation to Rust will be available.
