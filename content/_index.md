# Cation Language

Cation is a modern general-purpose programming language made with category theory in mind. It is purely functional
and uses statical and strong generalized algebraic data types known as [strict types][strict types].

The language design and compiler is a work in progress. The compiler will compile the code into LLVM and [AluVM](AluVM)
targets, and a special cross-compiler from Cation to Rust will be available.

# Features

1. ![Applied Category Theory](/symbols/act.svg)
   The (first) categorical programming language with notations close to mathematics
2. ![Formal analysis](/symbols/analysis.svg)
   Termination analysis, generalized algebraic data types and formal verification
3. ![Fun to program](/symbols/fun.svg)
   Easy to read and fun to program, avoid visual clutter and boilerplate
